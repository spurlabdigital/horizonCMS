## Horizon CMS

The backend utilizes the Kirby CMS. To install and utilize it effectively, refer to the guide at Kirby Quickstart (https://getkirby.com/docs/guide/quickstart). The final content isn't pushed to this repository, and users are removed for security reason. Kirby generates JSON files for both the Horizon AR and the Horizon Museum app (https://getkirby.com/docs/guide/templates/content-representations).

To just view JSON for the Horizon AR app or the Horizon Museum app you can visit:
